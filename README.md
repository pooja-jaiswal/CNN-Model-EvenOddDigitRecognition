# CNN-Model-EvenOddDigitRecognition

A CNN model using Keras where I trained my custom CNN model and evaluate it in a manner that my 
CNN model is able to identify the numbers in the MNIST dataset as either even or odd labeled by the corresponding integer. 
Saving the model as cnn_model.h5 and analyzing the accuracy, entropy loss, learning rate and other parameters.
